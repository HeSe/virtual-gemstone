This file describes the roadmap of next things to do:

milestone 1:

appliance provides:

- veewee definition for basebox to use
- no automatic build of the basebox. Files are provided but the actions need to be done automatically
- automatic start of all needed components if the system comes up
- gemstone 2.4.4.x installation (version 3.0 has issues)
- one stone running with 3 gems serving requests
- any working web adaptor in gemstone.
- seaside Installation
- nginx frontend web server
- monit to start and check gem processes

This milestone is done if one can build a basebox with veewee, use this basebox with vagrant to bootstrap the appliance. After the appliance has been bootstrapped it should be possible to access the seaside home page by accessing

http://localhost:8080/

from the workstation.
